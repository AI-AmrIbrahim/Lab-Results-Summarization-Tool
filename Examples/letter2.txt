Hello [Patient's Name]!

I hope this letter finds you well. Following your recent visit and blood work, I wanted to provide you with an overview of your results, explain what they mean, and discuss some steps we can take together to support your health and wellbeing.

Firstly, your hemoglobin A1c level has increased slightly from 5.7 to 6.2 over the past 11 months. This level places you in the prediabetes category, indicating a higher than normal blood sugar level. It’s important, but not uncommon, and there are many strategies we can employ to manage and potentially reverse this trend.

Your BMI is currently 41.2, which falls into the obesity category. I understand that your work as an actress and dancer involves physical activity, yet it may not be providing the variety or intensity of exercise needed to support weight management and improve blood sugar levels.

On a positive note, your ferritin, B12 levels, and thyroid function are all within normal ranges, and your cholesterol levels, including an LDL of 66, are excellent. These are strong indicators of your overall health and something to be proud of.

I understand you’ve been feeling tired frequently, which can be concerning and frustrating. While this may be related to your elevated A1c levels and BMI, there are ways we can work together to improve your energy levels.

Lifestyle Management Recommendations:

Nutritional Counseling: Considering your current health indicators, meeting with a dietitian could be highly beneficial. A dietitian can tailor nutritional advice to your individual needs, helping to manage blood sugar levels and support weight loss. Emphasizing a balanced diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can have a significant impact.  I am sending a referral to Jami Mansing RD for nutritional consultation for you in a separate myChart message. 

Structured Exercise Program: While your job involves physical activity, adding a structured exercise regimen can aid in weight management and improve blood sugar control. This might include aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Given your background in dance, you might find activities like yoga or Pilates particularly enjoyable and beneficial.

Stress Management: High levels of stress can impact your blood sugar levels and contribute to fatigue. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, or even participating in hobbies or activities you enjoy can help reduce stress.

Regular Monitoring: It’s important to continue monitoring your health indicators, including your hemoglobin A1c and BMI, at regular intervals. This will help us assess the effectiveness of the lifestyle changes and adjust as needed. 

I understand that making lifestyle changes can be challenging, especially with a busy schedule. However, small, incremental changes can lead to significant health improvements over time. I’m here to support you every step of the way.

Please feel free to reach out to schedule a follow-up appointment or if you have any questions or concerns about this information or your health in general. Together, we can work towards improving your health outcomes and enhancing your quality of life.

Have a great week!

Dr. [Your Name]
